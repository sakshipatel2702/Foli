            <h5>Website Visitors</h5>
            Like most website operators, Foli collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Foli's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Foli's visitors use its website. From time to time, Foli may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Foli also collects potentially personally-identifying information like internet protocol (ip) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://www.Foli.com/ blog posts. Foli only discloses logged in user and commenter ip addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h5>Gathering of Personally-identifying Information</h5>
            Certain visitors to Foli's websites choose to interact with Foli in ways that require Foli to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Foli gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://www.Foli.com/ to provide a username and email address.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            <h5>Security</h5>
            The security of your personal information is important to us, but remember that no
            method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100%
            secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
